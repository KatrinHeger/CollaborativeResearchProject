# Collaborative Research Project

This folder contains all relevant documents related to the collaborative research project of the class “Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis” at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin, created by Katrin Heger and Benedikt Abendroth.

In brief, we address the observation that many states have recently pursued the strategy to intervene in conflicts by delivering weapons to one of the involved parties in order to end the conflict by providing them with the necessary military resources to gain victory over the other parties. Especially the Ukraine as well as Syria can serve as prominent examples. However, as most of the literature fails to disentangle various forms of interventions by lumping together military intervention on the one and economic intervention on the other hand, our goal is to investigate the specific effects of arms supply to one side of the conflict.

In order to perform statistical analysis with R Studio, we will use publicly available data sets from the University of Uppsala Conflict Database Program (UCDP) to provide reproducible and open source research.

Our current proposal can be read in the R Markdown file “CollabResearch_Assignment1.Rmd”. Hence, we used its standard citation style Chicago. In addition, the bibliography will be automatically added after the section called “References”.

In case you have any questions or recommendations feel free to reach out to us or send any push requests!
