**Motivation**


After the end of the Cold War there was optimism that the number of conflicts would decrease, but this hope was dashed with the emergence of numerous intrastate conflicts in Europe, Africa, and Asia. Although the incidences of conflict have declined over the last decade, the world seems far from being in peace with conflicts currently raging in Syria, Ukraine, Yemen, South Sudan and the DR Congo. Delivering money, weapons, and training to conflict zones has become a convenient solution for many Western states that constitutes a middle ground between being a passive bystander and sending troops. In Syria, the US provided weapons to the rebels fighting the autocratic Assad regime and in Ukraine, the pro-government forces have received arms in order to fight the separatist movement. In policy-making, military intervention is often depicted as a solution to internal conflicts, while at the same time, academic research has revealed that intervention oftentimes rather prolongs and exacerbates civil wars.

**Research Question**

Our research project analyzes how different types of third-party intervention into intrastate wars affect the outcome of the conflict. The following charts illustrate the distribution of support types and conflict outcomes for 169 conflict units covering the years 1975 to 2009.


**Intervention Types**

We differentiated between 1) Troops, 2) Military and 3) Non-military as types of support to either the government or the rebels. 

```{r, two_plots_same_size_side_by_side, header=FALSE, echo=FALSE, dpi=65}
qplot(Dataset_1_gtype_HG$gtypesup_cat, geom = "histogram", binwidth = 1, main = "Government Support Types", xlab = "Support Types", ylab = "Frequency", alpha = I(.9), fill = I("lightgreen")) + 
scale_x_discrete(breaks = 1:3, labels=c("Troops","Military","Non-military")) +
xlab(NULL)
qplot(Dataset_1_rtype_HG$rtypesup_cat, geom = "histogram", main = "Frequency of Rebel Support Types", xlab = "Support Types", ylab = "Frequency", alpha = I(.9), fill = I("brown")) + 
scale_x_discrete(breaks = 1:3, labels=c("Troops","Military","Non-military")) +
xlab(NULL)
```


**Conflict Outcomes**

As illustrated below, most conflicts end up with low activity (less than 25 battle field related deaths per year). However, negotiated settlements and government victories each occur approx. twice as often as rebel victories. 

```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
qplot(Dataset_1$conflict_outcome, geom = "histogram", binwidth = .5, main = "Conflict Outcomes", xlab = "Outcome Types (see below)", ylab = "Frequency", fill = I("lightblue"))
```

*0: Low Activity*, *1: Rebel Victory*, *2: Negotiated Settlement*, *3: Government Victory*


**Results**

TBD
